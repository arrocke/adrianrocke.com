        Pivot Interactives uses slow motion video and unique measurement tools to enable students to discover scientific models of real events.
        An online library of activities covers the breadth of physics, while biology and chemistry are currently in development.
        Additionally, teachers can create activities using their own videos or with videos from their students.
